With her background in climate science, she was a perfect pick for the program Mission 2041- which aims to clean up more than 300 million tonnes of Carbon Dioxide. Kaushik consistently saw the horrible effects of global warming on the poor continent of Antarctica which was covered with melting glaciers and destroyed wildlife for native animals. Kaushik has actively pledged to address this problem by bringing up more clean technology in India with the help of Mahindra Susten.

							<h6>Pratul Vishera</h6>
							<p>A 24- year old Musician/Astrologer/Mythologist hailing from Agra. He has deep interest towards science, arts, culture, philosophy and there is nothing called "hobby" in his life, there is always a "passion" and in some cases, it is an obsession. This unquenchable thirst of knowledge put him into astrology as he was always attracted towards occult sciences. So, there was an incident which happened with him where a Jyotish fooled his parents by saying that he has "Kaal Sarp Yog". By hearing such heavy and frightening words his parents got worried and they did everything as per that idiot pandit and it cost them around 7,000 Rs for that ceremony which happened in the water body around 4 AM in the month of January. But later, when his interest grew up in astrology and started learning about it he found that there is no such Yog in my chart, and he has lived 2 years of his life by believing that he is a born loser and nothing good can happen in his life. So on that day, he has decided that he will aware people as much as he can about the several myths of it and would help them by showing them a positive and practical way.
