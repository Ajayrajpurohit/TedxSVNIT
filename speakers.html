								<h6>Nikhil Malhotra</h6>
	<p>Renowned for being an amazing father, Nikhil Malhotra was instrumental in the innovation of the healthcare robot Saarthi. His inputs, along with his little son’s, helped the healthcare robot become a reality which has the potential to help millions, maybe even billions of people all over the world. The initial idea of Saarthi was achieved by Malhotra through the numerous questions asked by his four-year old son, Angad, about what a robot could possibly do in the future. Nikhil Malhotra is the creator of Maker’s Lab, a unique Thin-q-bator space within TechMahindra with over 17 years of experience in a variety of technology domains.

								<h6>Surmai Kaushik</h6>
								<p>A backpacker, a conservationist, an educator and a marathon runner.  While working at Mahindra Susten- Mahindra’s clean technology arm- Surmai Kaushik got the greatest opportunity of her life- to go to Antarctica with Robert Swann. While this may not be everyone’s cup of coffee, it certainly was for Surmai who has been trying to raise awareness of climate change for her entire life. With her background in climate science, she was a perfect pick for the program Mission 2041- which aims to clean up more than 300 million tonnes of Carbon Dioxide. Kaushik consistently saw the horrible effects of global warming on the poor continent of Antarctica which was covered with melting glaciers and destroyed wildlife for native animals. Kaushik has actively pledged to address this problem by bringing up more clean technology in India with the help of Mahindra Susten.

								<h6>Jitendra Singh</h6>
								<p>Jitendra Singh is a security guard at SVNIT, Surat. He once had a dream of joining the Indian Defence Services but couldn’t due to him lacking in physical requirements. This  however, did not bog Singh down; instead it inspired him to do something great in another way- he decide to honour those people who have joined and sacrificed their lives for the country. He has written over 6000 letters over the past 15 years to the families of martyrs. He believes that if someone has sacrificed something for the betterment of society and country, he should receive encouraging words from those people for whom they have sacrificed.

								<h6>Pratul Vishera</h6>
								<p>A 24- year old Musician/Astrologer/Mythologist hailing from Agra. He has deep interest towards science, arts, culture, philosophy and there is nothing called "hobby" in his life, there is always a "passion" and in some cases, it is an obsession. This unquenchable thirst of knowledge put him into astrology as he was always attracted towards occult sciences. So, there was an incident which happened with him where a Jyotish fooled his parents by saying that he has "Kaal Sarp Yog". By hearing such heavy and frightening words his parents got worried and they did everything as per that idiot pandit and it cost them around 7,000 Rs for that ceremony which happened in the water body around 4 AM in the month of January. But later, when his interest grew up in astrology and started learning about it he found that there is no such Yog in my chart, and he has lived 2 years of his life by believing that he is a born loser and nothing good can happen in his life. So on that day, he has decided that he will aware people as much as he can about the several myths of it and would help them by showing them a positive and practical way.
